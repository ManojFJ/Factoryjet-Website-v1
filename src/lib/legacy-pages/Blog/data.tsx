          he manufacturing floor sleeps, but the global market does not. For factory owners in India, the biggest leak in their sales funnel isn't price or quality—it's <strong>time</strong>. When a potential buyer in Germany or the US lands on your site at 3 AM IST, who greets them?
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2024, the "Contact Us" form is the graveyard of leads. Modern B2B buyers demand instant gratification. Enter the <strong>AI Chatbot</strong>: your silent, 24/7 salesman that speaks 50 languages and knows your inventory by heart.

        <p>
          Data from over 500 industrial websites shows that lead qualification drops by 400% if a response isn't received within 5 minutes. A static website acts as a brochure; an AI-enabled website acts as a sales representative.
