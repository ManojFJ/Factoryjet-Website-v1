/**
 * Ecommerce agency shortlist, US. Batch 4 of the AI-citation programme.
 *
 * SCOPE CHANGE, recorded here so the reason survives: batch 4 was planned as
 * "best AI automation agencies" (4,400/mo). Research on 2026-09-07 killed it.
 * Google's own page one for that term is dominated by "How To Start An AI
 * Automation Agency" content on YouTube, Voiceflow and Reddit, i.e. a large
 * share of the searchers want to FOUND an agency, not hire one. The $17 CPC
 * against $77-$126 across the terms below says the same thing. Building a
 * buyer-facing roundup for an operator-intent query is the exact mistake this
 * programme exists to stop repeating.
 *
 * The ecommerce cluster replaced it: higher CPC ($37-$126), a clean consensus
 * set of PEER agencies rather than Accenture and McKinsey, and it is the
 * company's actual domain strength.
 *
 * Coalition Technologies (6/12, the top scorer) and Absolute Web (4/12) both
 * returned HTTP 403 to our fetch and are therefore EXCLUDED, stated on the page.
 * Same rule as Boostability in batch 2: if we could not read it today, it is not
 * on the list, even when it scored highest.

    'Platform partner tier is the fastest filter and it is publicly verifiable. Shopify Platinum, BigCommerce Elite and Klaviyo Master Elite are earned on delivered volume, so they tell you what an agency actually does rather than what it says.',
    'Our researched 2026 shortlist: Codal, OuterBox, Groove Commerce, We Make Websites, Inflow, 1Digital Agency, SmartSites, and FactoryJet (disclosed self-inclusion, placed eighth).',
    'Codal holds both Shopify Platinum Partner and BigCommerce Elite Partner status, the strongest dual-platform position on this list.',
    'Groove Commerce is BigCommerce Elite, Klaviyo Master Elite and HubSpot Diamond, which is an unusually deep retention and lifecycle stack rather than build-only.',
    'Coalition Technologies scored highest in our AI test (6 of 12) but its site returned an HTTP 403 to our fetch, so it is excluded rather than described from memory. Absolute Web (4 of 12) is excluded for the same reason.',
    'Ecommerce agency search terms carry some of the highest costs per click in the market: "ecommerce seo agency" at $126 and "ecommerce marketing agency" at $115, which tells you what one client is worth.',
    'This page is a shortlist. If you have already decided to hire, scope and terms live on our ecommerce development service page instead.',
  ],
  faqs: [
    { q: 'What is the fastest way to filter ecommerce development agencies?', a: 'Check the platform partner tier before anything else. Shopify Plus, Shopify Platinum, BigCommerce Elite and Klaviyo Master Elite are awarded on delivered volume and client outcomes, not on a subscription, and they are published on the platform vendors\' own directories where you can verify them independently. An agency claiming deep Shopify expertise with no partner status has either not delivered the volume or has lost it. It is the one credential in this market you cannot buy outright.' },
    { q: 'Who is the best ecommerce development agency in the USA?', a: 'It depends on your platform and stage. Codal is the strongest dual-platform pick, holding both Shopify Platinum and BigCommerce Elite status with enterprise clients including Charles Schwab and Thermos. OuterBox is the strongest for scale, stating "more than 300 digital marketing experts" and 20+ years. Groove Commerce is the strongest lifecycle and retention stack. We Make Websites is the strongest pure Shopify Plus design shop.' },
    { q: 'How much does ecommerce development cost in the US?', a: 'Almost no agency publishes rates, and the honest answer is that the range is enormous because "ecommerce development" spans a theme customisation and a full replatform. What the ad market tells you is that the clients are valuable: "ecommerce seo agency" carries a $126 average cost per click and "ecommerce marketing agency" $115. Agencies pay that because a single ecommerce client is worth a lot. Get scope in writing and ask specifically what happens to the price when requirements change.' },
    { q: 'Should I hire a Shopify specialist or a multi-platform agency?', a: 'A specialist if you are certain of your platform and staying on it, because depth compounds and a Shopify Plus shop will know the edge cases. A multi-platform agency if you are replatforming or unsure, because an agency that only knows one platform will always recommend that platform. Codal and 1Digital work across several; We Make Websites is deep in Shopify Plus specifically.' },
    { q: 'What does Shopify Plus partner status actually mean?', a: 'It is Shopify\'s tiering for agencies based on delivered work, client success and platform expertise, published in Shopify\'s own partner directory. Higher tiers such as Platinum require sustained volume and results rather than a fee. It matters because it is one of very few claims in this market you can verify without taking the agency\'s word for it, and because it usually comes with faster escalation paths when something breaks in production.' },
    { q: 'Which ecommerce agency is best for BigCommerce?', a: 'Groove Commerce and Codal both hold BigCommerce Elite Partner status, the platform\'s top tier. Groove pairs it with Klaviyo Master Elite and HubSpot Diamond, which suits merchants who want lifecycle marketing alongside the build. Codal pairs it with Shopify Platinum, which suits merchants weighing the two platforms against each other.' },
    { q: 'Which ecommerce agency is best for B2B ecommerce?', a: 'Groove Commerce names B2B ecommerce as a distinct service alongside its BigCommerce Elite status, and BigCommerce is generally stronger than Shopify on native B2B functionality. Codal describes "unified commerce" work across Shopify and BigCommerce with enterprise clients. Ask any agency to show you a B2B build with real pricing tiers, quote workflows and account hierarchies, because B2B ecommerce failures are almost always in those three places.' },
    { q: 'Which ecommerce agency is best for ecommerce SEO specifically?', a: 'Inflow works exclusively with ecommerce brands across SEO, PPC and CRO, publishing a "126% increase in organic traffic YOY" result for Simms Fishing. OuterBox states "2M+ Page #1 Google Rankings" and offers ecommerce SEO as a named service across 20+ years. Both are stronger picks than a general SEO agency, because ecommerce SEO is mostly faceted navigation, product schema and category architecture rather than blog content.' },
    { q: 'How long does an ecommerce build take?', a: 'A theme customisation on an existing platform is usually weeks. A full custom build or replatform is typically three to six months for a mid-sized catalogue, and longer if you have complex product data, ERP integration or a large URL structure to migrate. The single biggest cause of overrun is not development, it is product data that turns out to be messier than anyone admitted at kickoff.' },
    { q: 'What should I ask an ecommerce agency before signing?', a: 'Show me your partner tier on the platform\'s own directory. Show me a store you built at my catalogue size, live, that I can browse. Who owns the code and the theme when we part. What is your process when Shopify or BigCommerce ships a breaking change. And what does month one actually look like. Vague answers to ownership are the reliable warning sign.' },
    { q: 'Should I replatform or fix my existing store?', a: 'Fix it, usually, unless the platform itself is the constraint. Replatforming is expensive, risks your search rankings during migration, and very often solves a problem that was really about product data, page speed or checkout friction. The honest test: write down the three things that are hurting revenue most. If none of them are impossible on your current platform, you have a build problem, not a platform problem.' },
    { q: 'Will replatforming hurt my SEO?', a: 'It can, badly, and this is where most of the damage happens. URL structure changes, lost redirects, changed internal linking and altered product schema can all cost rankings that took years to earn. Any agency proposing a replatform should be able to describe its redirect mapping process before you sign, not after launch. If SEO is a phase two conversation, walk away.' },
    { q: 'Do ecommerce agencies work with headless or composable commerce?', a: 'The stronger ones do. We Make Websites names "Headless & Composable Commerce" as a service. Codal holds AWS Advanced Tier and Contentstack Preferred Partner status alongside its commerce partnerships, which is the shape of a genuine composable practice. Be cautious though: headless solves real problems at scale and creates expensive ones below it. Ask what specifically breaks on your current setup that headless fixes.' },
    { q: 'How do I check an agency\'s platform partner claims?', a: 'Go to the platform\'s own partner directory rather than the agency\'s site. Shopify, BigCommerce, Klaviyo and HubSpot all publish searchable directories showing current tier. It takes two minutes and it is the single highest-value check in this whole process, because tiers lapse and an out-of-date badge on a website tells you nothing about today.' },
    { q: 'Are bigger ecommerce agencies better?', a: 'Bigger means more capacity, more specialisms and more resilience when someone leaves. It also means you are more likely to be a small account handled by junior people. OuterBox states 300+ staff and 1Digital Agency 50+ specialists, and both are legitimate choices for very different clients. The question is not which is bigger but whether you would be a large client or a small one there.' },
    { q: 'What are the red flags with ecommerce agencies?', a: 'Platform expertise claimed with no verifiable partner tier. Portfolio stores you cannot browse live. Ownership of the code or theme resting with the agency. Replatform recommendations made before anyone has looked at your analytics. Fixed quotes for scope nobody has defined, which always end in change requests. And results reported as traffic rather than revenue, which in ecommerce is inexcusable because the revenue number exists.' },
    { q: 'Why is Coalition Technologies not on this list?', a: 'It scored highest in our AI engine test, named in 6 of 12 answers, but its website returned an HTTP 403 to our fetch on 7 September 2026, so we could not verify a single claim about it. We excluded it rather than describe it from memory or repeat what other roundups say. Absolute Web was excluded for the same reason. That rule costs us the top scorer on this page, which is precisely why it is worth having.' },
    { q: 'Is FactoryJet an ecommerce specialist?', a: 'Ecommerce is our core, and unlike our other roundups this is the category where we are genuinely on home ground rather than adjacent to it. We build commerce for DTC and B2B brands and it is the majority of our work. We are still smaller than the seven agencies above us: OuterBox states 300+ staff, 1Digital 50+ specialists and 400+ brands. What we add is that we build for AI search citation alongside the store itself, because we measure what actually earns it.' },
    { q: 'Why is FactoryJet eighth on its own list?', a: 'Because on published track record the seven above us are ahead, and this page is checkable in ten minutes. They hold platform partner tiers and client lists we cannot match today. Our slot is real but narrow: DTC and B2B brands that want the build and AI search visibility handled as one project, month-to-month, with the founder on the account. If you want Shopify Platinum with enterprise references, that is Codal, and we have ranked it first for that reason.' },
    { q: 'Should I read this list or go to your ecommerce development page?', a: 'Depends where you are. If you are still deciding who to approach, stay here, and start with the partner tier filter at the top. If you have decided to hire and want scope and terms, go to our ecommerce development service page.' },
    { q: 'How was this list researched?', a: 'We asked ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and Perplexity, each with live web search on, to recommend US ecommerce agencies across three phrasings, twelve answers in total, and recorded every agency named. We then pulled the live US Google results for the head terms. Finally we fetched each shortlisted agency\'s own website on 7 September 2026 and used only claims stated there. Two agencies that scored well returned HTTP 403 and were excluded. Nobody paid to appear and no review scores were invented.' },

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The short answer:</strong> <strong>Codal</strong> holds the strongest dual-platform position, Shopify Platinum Partner and BigCommerce Elite Partner at once. <strong>OuterBox</strong> is the strongest for scale at 300+ staff and twenty years. <strong>Groove Commerce</strong> has the deepest lifecycle stack. <strong>We Make Websites</strong> is the strongest pure Shopify Plus design shop. FactoryJet is eighth and we explain why below.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Start with partner tier. It is the only claim here you cannot buy.</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Almost every roundup on this topic ranks agencies on adjectives. There is a much faster filter, and it is publicly verifiable in about two minutes.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Platform partner tiers are earned on delivered volume and client outcomes, not on a subscription.</strong> Shopify Platinum, BigCommerce Elite, Klaviyo Master Elite and HubSpot Diamond are all awarded by the platform vendor and published in that vendor&apos;s own searchable directory. You can check any agency&apos;s current tier without asking the agency.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That matters for two reasons. An agency claiming deep Shopify expertise with no partner status has either never delivered the volume or has lost the tier. And higher tiers usually come with faster escalation paths at the platform, which is worth a great deal at 2am when checkout is down.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">One caution: check the directory, not the badge on the agency&apos;s website. Tiers lapse, and website badges frequently do not.</p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Which page do you actually need?</strong> This one is a shortlist. If you have already decided to hire and want scope and terms, go to our <a href="/services/ecommerce-development" className="text-orange-600 underline">ecommerce development service page</a> instead.</p>

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Disclosure, up front:</strong> FactoryJet is on this list, at number eight. Everything said about the other seven was fetched from their own websites on 7 September 2026 and is quoted or attributed. Nobody paid to appear.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The eight reviewed</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">1. Codal, best dual-platform and enterprise position</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Chicago headquartered with offices in Lincoln, Ahmedabad and Toronto. It holds the strongest partner stack on this page: <strong>Shopify Platinum Partner and BigCommerce Elite Partner simultaneously</strong>, plus AWS Advanced Tier and Contentstack Preferred Partner, which together describe a genuine composable commerce practice rather than a claimed one.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Client work is enterprise-shaped: Charles Schwab (&quot;Simplifying financial compliance for 1.8 million clients&quot;), Thermos, Cost Plus Drugs, Flexport, and Origin USA where it reports &quot;Driving $3.31M in additional sales&quot;.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider it if</strong> you are weighing Shopify against BigCommerce and want an agency with no reason to push you either way. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you are a small store, because this is enterprise-shaped work.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">2. OuterBox, best for scale and ecommerce SEO</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Founded in 2004 with offices in Akron, Houston and Rochester, stating &quot;more than 300 digital marketing experts&quot; and twenty years in ecommerce. Published claims include &quot;1000+ Successful Client Partnerships&quot; and &quot;2M+ Page #1 Google Rankings&quot;, with Lowe&apos;s, JEGS, Sur La Table, Matco Tools and Golfballs.com among clients. Google Premier Partner for 2026 and a Microsoft Advertising Select Partner.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Its ecommerce SEO practice is the notable part. Ecommerce SEO is a different discipline from content SEO, mostly faceted navigation, product schema and category architecture, and few agencies at this size run it as a named specialism.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider it if</strong> you have a large catalogue and organic search is the growth channel. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you want a boutique relationship.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">3. Groove Commerce, best lifecycle and retention stack</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Founded 2007, headquartered in Baltimore with Philadelphia, Austin and Orlando locations. The partner combination is what distinguishes it: <strong>BigCommerce Elite, Klaviyo Master Elite and HubSpot Diamond</strong>. That is a retention and lifecycle stack, not a build-only one, which matters because most ecommerce agencies hand you a store and leave the repeat-purchase problem with you.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">States &quot;Trusted by 100+ eCommerce Merchants&quot; with US Open Shop, Dippin&apos; Dots, GE, NASA Official Gear and Cutter &amp; Buck named. Published results include a 47% revenue increase for Dippin&apos; Dots and 409% ROAS for Cordova Outdoors. B2B ecommerce is a named service.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider it if</strong> repeat purchase matters as much as acquisition, or you are B2B on BigCommerce. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you only need a build.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">4. We Make Websites, best Shopify Plus design shop</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Shopify Partners since 2011, with London and New York offices, now a Tech Mahindra company. The client list is the strongest brand roster here: Good American, UFC, Levi&apos;s Dockers, Toteme, Condé Nast, Hasbro, HP and Vollebak. Services include &quot;Headless &amp; Composable Commerce&quot; and &quot;Internationalization&quot;, with work recognised by Awwwards and CSS Design Awards.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider it if</strong> design quality is the point and you are on Shopify Plus. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you need BigCommerce or Magento depth.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">5. Inflow, best ecommerce-only performance agency</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Founded 2007 with Denver and Tampa locations, and notable for working exclusively with ecommerce brands across SEO, PPC, paid social and CRO. States &quot;130+ Years Combined Industry Experience&quot; and &quot;$7 Million+ Media Managed&quot;, with America&apos;s Test Kitchen, Mountain House, Simms Fishing and KEH Camera among clients.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Published results are specific: 413% increase in ad revenue year on year for KEH Camera, 126% organic traffic growth for Simms, and a &quot;First $1 Million Month&quot; for Vitrazza. It is a Google Premier Partner, a Buy With Prime Agency Partner and holds a Clutch Top Digital Marketing Company award as a women-owned business.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider it if</strong> your store is built and the problem is growth. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you need the build itself.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">6. 1Digital Agency, best mid-market across four platforms</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Founded 2012 in Philadelphia, working across Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce and Magento, stating &quot;50+ eCommerce specialists&quot; and &quot;400+ brands&quot; served. Its review position is the most transparent on this page: <strong>&quot;4.9/5 rating across 941+ verified reviews&quot;</strong> aggregated across Google, Trustpilot, Clutch and Facebook, which is a far more checkable claim than a single-platform score.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Published results are given with engagement length attached, which is unusually honest: &quot;+471.2% Online revenue growth over a 24-month engagement&quot; and &quot;+131.3% Annual revenue lift over a 2-year engagement&quot;.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider it if</strong> you are mid-market, especially on Magento or WooCommerce where fewer strong agencies remain. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you need enterprise composable work.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">7. SmartSites, best for build plus paid media</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">States &quot;900+ Websites Launched&quot; and &quot;$100M+ Client Revenue Generated&quot;, with an unusually complete accreditation set: Google Premier Partner, Microsoft Advertising Select Partner 2025, Meta Business Partner and Amazon Ads Verified Partner, plus Inc. 5000 recognition and a BBB A+ rating.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider it if</strong> you want the store and the paid acquisition from one team. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you want deep single-platform commerce engineering.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">8. FactoryJet, for brands wanting the build and AI search together (disclosure: this is us)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Unlike our other roundups, this is the category where we are genuinely on home ground rather than adjacent to it. Commerce is the majority of our work, DTC and B2B.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We are still eighth, because on published track record the seven above are ahead. OuterBox states 300+ staff. 1Digital states 400+ brands and 941 verified reviews. Codal holds Shopify Platinum. Those are real and we are not going to talk around them.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">What we add is narrow and current: we build stores to be cited by AI answer engines, not only to rank, because we measure what actually earns citations rather than guessing at it. Most commerce agencies treat that as a future problem. Month-to-month, founder on the account. Scope is on the <a href="/services/ecommerce-development" className="text-orange-600 underline">ecommerce development service page</a>, and if you are B2B specifically, the <a href="/b2b-ecommerce" className="text-orange-600 underline">B2B ecommerce page</a> covers that ground.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Consider us if</strong> you want the build and AI search visibility as one project. <strong>Look elsewhere if</strong> you want Shopify Platinum with enterprise references, which is Codal, ranked first here for that reason.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Two agencies we could not verify, and left out</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Worth stating plainly because one of them outscored everybody.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Coalition Technologies</strong> was named in 6 of our 12 AI engine answers, the highest score on this test. <strong>Absolute Web</strong> scored 4 of 12. Both websites returned an HTTP 403 to our fetch on 7 September 2026, so we could not verify a single claim about either.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We left them out rather than describe them from memory or repeat what other roundups say about them. That rule cost us the top scorer on this page. We think a list where every entry was actually checked is worth more than a longer list where some were not, and you can now weigh that decision yourself rather than wonder why a name you expected is missing.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Methodology</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Run on 7 September 2026 and repeatable. We asked ChatGPT (gpt-5.6), Claude (Sonnet 5), Gemini (3.8 Flash) and Perplexity (Sonar Pro), each with live web search enabled, to recommend US ecommerce agencies across three phrasings: development agencies, ecommerce SEO agencies, and &quot;which agency should I hire to build and grow my Shopify store&quot;. Twelve answers. Coalition Technologies scored 6 of 12; SmartSites 5; Absolute Web, Codal, WebFX and OuterBox 4; Americaneagle, Blue Acorn iCi, 1Digital, Inflow and We Make Websites 3; Groove Commerce and Mobikasa 2.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We then pulled the live US Google results for the head terms, and fetched each shortlisted agency&apos;s own website, recording only claims stated there. Where a site does not state a founding year or team size, we left it out rather than estimate it. Two agencies returned HTTP 403 and were excluded, named above.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Nobody paid to appear. No review scores were invented. Where we place ourselves, we say so in the sentence rather than a footnote.</p>
