/**
 * AI receptionist PRODUCT comparison, US SMB. Different asset type from the five
 * agency roundups: these are SaaS products and we are a services company, so
 * FactoryJet is deliberately NOT ranked inside the product list. It appears as a
 * separate "when a custom build makes sense" section instead, because sneaking a
 * services company into a product ranking would be dishonest and readers spot it.
 *
 * WHY THIS TARGET (measured 2026-09-07): "ai agent development company" is
 * 720/mo. The job-shaped cluster an SMB actually searches is ~21,400/mo at
 * $34-$160 CPC: ai receptionist 12,100, ai answering service 2,400, virtual
 * receptionist service 1,900, ai phone answering service 1,300, 24/7 answering
 * service 1,000, answering service for small business 720, call answering
 * service 720. Buyers search the job, not the technology.
 *
 * Every price fetched from the vendor's own pricing page on 2026-09-07. The
 * worked monthly costs are OUR arithmetic on THEIR published rates, labelled as
 * such with the assumption stated, never presented as vendor claims.
 *
 * Distinct from two existing posts that cover cost generically and name no
 * products: ai-voice-agents-vs-human-answering-services-cost-comparison-2026 and
 * how-much-does-an-ai-medical-receptionist-cost-2026. Both cross-linked.

      'We compared eight AI receptionist and answering service options on published pricing. The same call volume ranges from $40 to $1,965 a month. Full pricing tables, no gated quotes.',
  },
  keyTakeaways: [
    'The same workload, 200 calls a month at about three minutes each, ranges from roughly $40 to $1,965 a month depending purely on which pricing model you pick. Nothing about the job changes.',
    'There are three different products being sold under one name: developer platforms priced per minute (Vapi, Retell, Bland), turnkey subscriptions priced flat (Goodcall, RingCentral), and human services priced per call or per minute (Smith.ai, Ruby).',
    'Synthflow ranks on Google page one for "ai receptionist" but states "Enterprise contracts start at $30,000 annually". If you are a small business, that result is not for you and nothing on the search page tells you.',
    'Vapi is the cheapest per minute at $0.05, but HIPAA compliance is a $2,000/month add-on and call history is retained 14 days on the Build plan. For a medical practice, the cheapest option becomes one of the dearest.',
    'Goodcall is the clearest genuine small business pricing: $79, $129 or $249 a month per agent with unlimited minutes, so your bill does not move when you have a busy month.',
    'Ruby is fully human at $1,725/month for 500 minutes. That is the honest anchor: it is what you are comparing against, and it is why AI is interesting.',
    'Per-minute platforms are developer tools, not products. The rate excludes the work of building, integrating and maintaining the agent, which is the actual cost for most small businesses.',
  ],
  faqs: [
    { q: 'What is the best AI receptionist for a small business?', a: 'For most small businesses that just want it working, Goodcall is the clearest fit at $79 to $249 a month per agent with unlimited minutes, because the bill does not move when calls spike. If you have developer resource and want the lowest running cost, Vapi at $0.05 a minute or Retell from $0.07 a minute are cheaper to run but you are building and maintaining the agent yourself. If you need real humans on unusual or sensitive calls, Smith.ai and Ruby are the established options at much higher cost.' },
    { q: 'How much does an AI receptionist cost per month?', a: 'It depends entirely on the pricing model, and the spread is enormous. Taking a common small business load of 200 calls a month at about three minutes each, our arithmetic on published rates puts Vapi near $40, Retell near $70, Bland Start near $84, Goodcall Growth at $129 flat, Ruby at $1,725 for its 500 minute plan, and Smith.ai Basic near $1,965 once overage is counted. Same job, roughly a fiftyfold difference.' },
    { q: 'Why is there such a huge price difference between AI receptionists?', a: 'Because three different products share the name. Developer platforms sell you raw minutes and expect you to build the agent. Turnkey subscriptions sell you a working product with a flat fee. Human services sell you actual people answering the phone. Comparing a per-minute rate to a human answering service is comparing a bag of flour to a delivered cake, and most comparison articles do exactly that.' },
    { q: 'Is Vapi or Retell cheaper than Goodcall?', a: 'On the raw rate, yes, substantially. On the real cost, usually not for a small business. Vapi at $0.05 a minute and Retell from $0.07 are developer platforms: somebody has to design the conversation, connect your calendar and CRM, test the failure cases and maintain it as things change. Goodcall at $129 a month is a product you configure. If you do not have developer resource, the cheap per-minute rate is the smaller part of what it actually costs you.' },
    { q: 'Which AI receptionist is best for a medical or dental practice?', a: 'Be careful here, because the cheapest option flips. Vapi lists HIPAA as a $2,000 a month add-on, which turns the lowest per-minute platform into one of the most expensive for a small practice. Any vendor you use for patient calls needs a signed BAA, and you should confirm data retention: Vapi states 14 days of call history on the Build plan. For practice-specific detail see our guide on what an AI medical receptionist costs.' },
    { q: 'What does Synthflow cost?', a: 'Its pricing page states "Enterprise contracts start at $30,000 annually", with final pricing scoped around call volume, concurrency, telephony, integrations and security. It publishes no small business tier. This matters because Synthflow ranks on Google page one for "ai receptionist", so a small business owner searching that term is very likely to click a product with a $30,000 floor and find that out several steps later.' },
    { q: 'What does Retell AI cost?', a: 'Pay as you go at "$0.07-$0.31 / min for AI Voice Agents", with $10 in free credits and 20 free concurrent calls to start. Phone numbers are "$10.00/Phone number/month" and extra concurrency "$8.00/Concurrency/month". It publishes an unusually transparent component breakdown: voice infrastructure at $0.055/minute, text to speech from $0.015 to $0.040, and model costs such as GPT 5.5 at $0.16/minute or Claude 4.6 Sonnet at $0.08/minute. That spread is why the headline range is so wide: your model choice drives it.' },
    { q: 'What does Bland AI cost?', a: 'Three published tiers: Start at "$0.14/min" with no platform fee and no card required, Build at "$0.12/min" plus a "$299/month platform fee", and Scale at "$0.11/min" plus "$499/month". Transfers are charged separately from $0.03 to $0.05 a minute. Note that the platform fee only pays for itself at volume: at 600 minutes a month, Start at $84 beats Build at $371.' },
    { q: 'What does Vapi cost?', a: 'The Build plan is "$0.05 / min" for calls with 10 concurrent lines included and "$10 / line / mo" beyond that, and model provider costs are charged "At cost ($0 if you bring your own API key)". Two add-ons matter for regulated businesses: HIPAA at "$2000/mo" and Zero Data Retention at "$1000/mo". Call history is retained 14 days.' },
    { q: 'What does Goodcall cost?', a: 'Three published tiers billed per agent per month: Starter at "$79 monthly per agent", Growth at "$129 monthly per agent" and Scale at "$249 monthly per agent", each with unlimited minutes and tokens. Annual billing takes 15% off, bringing Starter to $66 and Growth to $108. The limit to watch is unique customers per month: 100, 250 and 500 respectively, then $0.50 per customer after.' },
    { q: 'What does Smith.ai cost, and is it AI or human?', a: 'Both, and it is priced like a human service because it largely is one. Published plans are Starter at "$300 / month" for 30 calls, Basic at "$810 / month" for 90 calls and Pro at "$2,100 / month" for 300 calls, with overage from $8.50 to $11.50 per call. It describes itself as "Live-staffed with expert agents 24/7" with both AI-first and human-first options, and includes a 30-day money-back guarantee with no setup fees and no charge for spam calls.' },
    { q: 'What does Ruby cost?', a: 'Ruby is fully human, describing "100% live, personalized communication". Published virtual receptionist plans are $250 a month for 50 minutes, $395 for 100 minutes, $720 for 200 minutes and $1,725 for 500 minutes. Live chat is priced separately from $143 a month, with about 20% off when bundled. It states no additional fees for activation, onboarding, setup or customisation.' },
    { q: 'Are AI receptionists actually good enough to replace a human?', a: 'For routine calls, increasingly yes: taking a booking, answering opening hours, capturing a lead, routing to the right person. For emotionally charged, ambiguous or high-value conversations, no, and any vendor claiming otherwise is overselling. The sensible pattern is not replacement but triage: the AI handles the routine majority and hands the rest to a person with the context already captured. Ask every vendor how the handoff to a human works, because that is where the weak products show.' },
    { q: 'What should an AI receptionist integrate with?', a: 'At minimum your calendar and whatever system your bookings actually live in, because an agent that cannot write to your scheduling software just creates a second inbox. RingCentral lists Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Calendar and Outlook. Goodcall works in logic flows and directory contacts. The developer platforms integrate with anything, which is their advantage and also the work. Before buying, name the one system it must write into and confirm it in writing.' },
    { q: 'Do I need to change my phone number or phone system?', a: 'Usually not. Most of these work by call forwarding, so you keep your number and route calls to the agent either always, after hours, or only when your line is busy. RingCentral states its AI Receptionist "works with your existing phone systems" and is available "as a standalone or add-on license", connecting via call forwarding or SIP. Starting with after-hours only is the lowest-risk way to try one.' },
    { q: 'What is the cheapest way to try an AI receptionist?', a: 'Bland Start requires no card and includes credits plus an inbound number described as a "$15/mo value". Retell gives $10 in free credits and 20 free concurrent calls. Vapi includes 60+ minutes on the Build plan. Any of those lets you hear the quality on your own call flow before spending, which is worth more than any comparison article including this one.' },
    { q: 'Should I buy an AI receptionist product or have one built?', a: 'Buy, in most cases. If your calls are reasonably standard and your scheduling software is mainstream, a product like Goodcall will be live faster and cheaper than anything custom. Building makes sense when you hit a wall the product cannot get past: an intake process that does not fit its logic flows, a system it will not integrate with, compliance it does not cover, or a multi-step workflow that spans several tools. That is a real threshold, not a sales line, and most small businesses never reach it.' },
    { q: 'What questions should I ask before buying?', a: 'Five. What does this actually cost at my call volume, in writing, including overage. What happens when the AI cannot handle the call. Which of my systems does it write into, and has it done that exact integration before. What is your data retention, and can you sign a BAA if I need one. And can I hear a recording of it handling a call like mine. Vendors that dodge the first and last are the ones to drop.' },
    { q: 'Does FactoryJet sell an AI receptionist product?', a: 'No, and that is worth being clear about because everything else on this page does. We are a services company: we build custom AI receptionists for businesses that have outgrown the off-the-shelf products or cannot use them. If a product on this list fits your needs, buy the product. It will be cheaper and faster than hiring us, and we would rather tell you that than take a project that should have been a $129 subscription.' },
    { q: 'How was this comparison researched?', a: 'Every price was fetched from the vendor\'s own published pricing page on 7 September 2026 and is quoted verbatim. Where a vendor publishes no rate, we say so rather than estimating. The monthly cost comparison is our own arithmetic applied to those published rates at a stated assumption of 200 calls a month averaging three minutes, and is labelled as our calculation rather than a vendor claim. No vendor paid to appear, none was contacted, and we sell none of these products.' },

      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The short answer:</strong> for most small businesses, <strong>Goodcall</strong> is the clearest fit at $79 to $249 a month with unlimited minutes. If you have developer resource, <strong>Vapi</strong> at $0.05 a minute and <strong>Retell</strong> from $0.07 are far cheaper to run but you are building the agent yourself.

      <p className="mb-4">Roughly a fiftyfold spread for the same task. Nothing about the phone calls changes across those rows. What changes is how much of the work you are doing yourself, and whether a human is involved.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Three products, one name</h2>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Developer platforms</strong> (Vapi, Retell, Bland) sell raw minutes. The rate is genuinely low, but it buys you an API, not a receptionist. Someone has to design the conversation, connect your calendar and CRM, test what happens when a caller says something unexpected, and maintain it. If you do not have that person, the per-minute rate is the smallest part of your real cost.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Turnkey products</strong> (Goodcall, RingCentral) sell a working thing you configure. More per minute, far less of your time, and a predictable bill.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Human services</strong> (Ruby, Smith.ai) sell actual people. Twenty times the price, and for some calls still worth it.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Comparing a per-minute rate against a human answering service is comparing a bag of flour to a delivered cake. Most comparison articles do exactly that, which is why the numbers never seem to make sense.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Three traps worth knowing before you click anything</h2>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>1. The page-one result that starts at $30,000 a year.</strong> Synthflow ranks on Google page one for &quot;ai receptionist&quot;. Its pricing page states &quot;Enterprise contracts start at $30,000 annually&quot; and publishes no smaller tier. If you are a small business, that result is not for you, and nothing on the search results page tells you that. It is a good product; it is simply not aimed at you.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>2. The cheapest option is the dearest for a medical practice.</strong> Vapi is the lowest per-minute rate on this page at $0.05. It also lists HIPAA as a <strong>$2,000 a month add-on</strong> and Zero Data Retention at $1,000 a month. For a small dental or medical practice, the cheapest platform instantly becomes one of the most expensive. Check compliance pricing before you fall in love with a per-minute rate.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>3. Platform fees only pay for themselves at volume.</strong> Bland&apos;s Build plan lowers the rate from $0.14 to $0.12 a minute but adds $299 a month. At 600 minutes that is $371 against $84 on the free-platform Start plan. The cheaper per-minute tier is the more expensive choice until you are running several thousand minutes a month. The same logic applies anywhere a platform fee appears.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The eight, individually</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Goodcall, best for most small businesses</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">The clearest genuine small business pricing here: <strong>$79, $129 or $249 a month per agent</strong>, all with &quot;Unlimited minutes and tokens&quot;, and 15% off annually taking Starter to $66. Unlimited minutes matters more than it sounds, because it means a busy month does not produce a surprise bill, which is the single most common complaint about usage-priced platforms.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The limit to watch is unique customers per month: 100, 250 and 500 by tier, then $0.50 per additional customer. Higher tiers also unlock more logic flows, which is how you handle several call types.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Vapi, cheapest per minute if you can build</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">&quot;$0.05 / min&quot; with 10 concurrent lines included, then $10 per line per month. Model costs are &quot;At cost ($0 if you bring your own API key)&quot;, which is genuinely generous. Two things to check before committing: HIPAA is $2,000/mo, and call history is retained 14 days on Build.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Retell AI, most transparent cost breakdown</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">&quot;$0.07-$0.31 / min&quot;, with $10 free credits and 20 free concurrent calls. What sets it apart is that it publishes the components: voice infrastructure at $0.055/minute, text to speech from $0.015 to $0.040, and model costs including GPT 5.5 at $0.16/minute and Claude 4.6 Sonnet at $0.08/minute. That is why the range is so wide, and it means you can control your rate by choosing a cheaper model. Very few vendors show you this.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Bland AI, easiest no-commitment start</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Start at &quot;$0.14/min&quot; with &quot;$0 platform fee. No card required&quot;, including credits and an inbound number described as a &quot;$15/mo value&quot;. Build and Scale drop the rate to $0.12 and $0.11 but add $299 and $499 monthly fees. Transfers bill separately at $0.03 to $0.05 a minute. All tiers include the model, transcription and premium voices with &quot;No token charges&quot;.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">RingCentral AI Receptionist, best if you already use RingCentral</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Ranks first on Google for the term. It handles 24/7 answering across simultaneous calls, scheduling, lead capture with custom intake questions, routing, FAQ resolution from your uploaded documents, SMS follow-up and multilingual detection. It integrates with Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Google Calendar and Outlook, and states it &quot;works with your existing phone systems&quot; as &quot;a standalone or add-on license&quot;.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The catch for a comparison like this: <strong>no pricing is published on the product page</strong>, which routes you to sales. We are not going to guess at a number.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Smith.ai, best hybrid of AI and real people</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">&quot;$300 / month&quot; for 30 calls, &quot;$810 / month&quot; for 90 and &quot;$2,100 / month&quot; for 300, with overage from $8.50 to $11.50 per call. It describes itself as &quot;Live-staffed with expert agents 24/7&quot; offering both AI-first and human-first modes, with a 30-day money-back guarantee, no setup fees and, usefully, &quot;No charge for spam&quot;.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Priced per call rather than per minute, which suits businesses with short calls and hurts those with long ones. Watch the overage: at 200 calls on the Basic plan you are paying more in overage than in subscription.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Ruby, fully human, and the honest anchor</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">$250 for 50 minutes, $395 for 100, $720 for 200 and $1,725 for 500 minutes, with live chat priced separately from $143 and about 20% off bundled. It is explicitly &quot;100% live, personalized communication&quot;, not AI, with no fees for activation, onboarding, setup or customisation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We include it because it is what you are actually comparing against. When people ask whether an AI receptionist is worth it, this is the alternative, and $1,725 a month for 500 minutes of human attention is the number that makes the question interesting.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Synthflow, capable but not for small business</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">&quot;Enterprise contracts start at $30,000 annually&quot;, scoped around call volume, concurrency, telephony setup, integrations, security and launch support. No smaller tier is published. Listed here mainly so you do not spend an afternoon discovering it, given where it ranks.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">When a custom build makes sense, and when it does not</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We should be straight about our position here, because everything above is a product and we are not one. <strong>FactoryJet does not sell an AI receptionist product.</strong> We build custom ones as a service, so we are not in the table and it would be dishonest to slip in at number nine.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Buy the product, in most cases.</strong> If your calls are reasonably standard and your scheduling software is mainstream, Goodcall or RingCentral will be live faster and cheaper than anything custom. We would rather say that than take on a project that should have been a $129 subscription.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">A custom build earns its cost when you hit a wall the product cannot get past. Usually one of four: an intake process that does not fit the product&apos;s logic flows, a system it will not integrate with, compliance it does not cover at a price you will pay, or a workflow that spans several tools and has to stay consistent across them. That is a real threshold and most small businesses never reach it. If you have, the scope is on our <a href="/services/ai-receptionist" className="text-orange-600 underline">AI receptionist page</a>.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Five questions before you buy anything</h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>What does this cost at my actual call volume, in writing, including overage?</strong> The headline rate is rarely the bill.</li>
        <li><strong>What happens when the AI cannot handle the call?</strong> The handoff is where weak products show.</li>
        <li><strong>Which of my systems does it write into, and have you done that exact integration before?</strong> An agent that cannot write to your scheduler is just a second inbox.</li>
        <li><strong>What is your data retention, and will you sign a BAA if I need one?</strong> Ask before you need it, not after.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I hear a recording of it handling a call like mine?</strong> Two minutes of audio beats any comparison article, this one included.</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="mb-4">Every price on this page was fetched from the vendor&apos;s own published pricing page on 7 September 2026 and is quoted verbatim. Where a vendor publishes no rate, we say so rather than estimating, which is why RingCentral has no number beside it.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The monthly cost table is <strong>our arithmetic applied to those published rates</strong>, at a stated assumption of 200 calls a month averaging three minutes, which is 600 minutes. It is our calculation, not a vendor quote, and your mix of call lengths will move it. We show the assumption so you can redo it with your own numbers.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">No vendor paid to appear and none was contacted. We sell none of these products and receive nothing if you buy one. Prices in this market change often, so check before you commit, and tell us if a figure here has moved and we will correct it.</p>
