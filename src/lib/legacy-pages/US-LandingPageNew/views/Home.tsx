      question: "Do you redesign existing websites or only build new ones?",
      answer: "We do both! If you have an existing website that needs a refresh, we can redesign it completely while preserving your content and maintaining your search engine rankings. Website redesigns typically take 4-6 weeks and cost 20-30% less than building from scratch since some content and assets already exist. We'll audit your current site, identify areas for improvement, and create a redesign strategy that addresses your goals.",
