    question: "Why is website design expensive in Delhi NCR compared to other cities?",
    answer: "Delhi NCR website design costs reflect the region's premium market demands, higher operational costs, and access to top-tier talent. However, \"expensive\" is relative — while some Delhi NCR agencies charge ₹2-5 Lakh for basic websites, FactoryJet offers competitive pricing starting at ₹29,999 without compromising quality. We achieve this through efficient processes, modern tools, and a focus on SMBs and startups rather than only enterprise clients. The investment pays off — a professional website in Delhi NCR's competitive market generates significantly more leads and revenue than DIY alternatives. Consider the cost of lost business from an unprofessional website — that's the real expense."

    question: "What affects the cost of e-commerce website development in Delhi NCR?",
    answer: "E-commerce website costs in Delhi NCR vary based on several factors: Platform choice (Shopify, WooCommerce, custom), number of products (50 vs 5000+ SKUs), design complexity (template vs custom), payment gateway requirements, shipping integration needs, inventory management features, multi-vendor capabilities, custom functionality requirements, and mobile app requirements. FactoryJet's e-commerce packages start at ₹99,999 for stores with up to 200 products, standard payment and shipping integration. Complex marketplaces or custom features require custom quotes."

    question: "Is cheap website design worth it for Delhi NCR businesses?",
    answer: "Cheap website design (under ₹15,000) typically comes with significant compromises that hurt Delhi NCR businesses: Generic templates used by thousands of sites, poor mobile experience losing 78% of traffic, no SEO optimization meaning zero Google visibility, limited functionality and no scalability, no support when things break, and unprofessional appearance damaging brand credibility. In Delhi NCR's competitive market, your website competes with well-funded startups and enterprises. A cheap website actually costs more in lost opportunities. FactoryJet's starter package at ₹29,999 provides professional quality that generates real business results."
