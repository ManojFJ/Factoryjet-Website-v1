export const FAQS: FAQItem[] = [
  {
    question: "So, what exactly does 'Digital Transformation' mean for my small business?",
    answer: "It sounds fancy, but it's simple: we use technology to fix what's slowing you down. Whether it's replacing paper logs with an app, automating your sales emails, or getting your shop online so you can sell 24/7. It's about making your business faster, smarter, and more profitable."
  },
  {
    question: "I've been burned by agencies before. How do I know you're different?",
    answer: "We hear this a lot, and it hurts us too. Here's our promise: We don't hide behind jargon, we don't hold your code hostage, and we don't disappear after launch. We have a 98% client satisfaction rate because we treat your business like our own. Plus, if you're not happy, we fix it—guaranteed."
  },
  {
    question: "How long has FactoryJet actually been around?",
    answer: "Our leadership team has been in the trenches for 25+ years. FactoryJet itself has been serving SMBs specifically for over a decade. We aren't a fly-by-night startup; we're a stable partner built for the long haul."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you outsource your work or is it all done in-house?",
    answer: "We have a dedicated team of 60+ full-time experts in India. For very niche requirements, we might bring in a trusted specialist, but 99% of the work is done by the team you meet. You're hiring us, not a random freelancer."
  },
  {
    question: "Where are you located? Can we meet in person?",
    answer: "We are headquartered in Bangalore, the Silicon Valley of India. We work remotely with clients across the globe, which keeps our costs (and yours) down. We're happy to jump on a video call anytime, and for major enterprise projects, we can arrange site visits."
  },
  {
    question: "I'm on a tight budget. Can I really afford 'Enterprise-grade' tech?",
    answer: "Absolutely. That's literally why we exist. We use smart tools (like Open Source ERPs and AI) to cut down development time and costs. You get the same power as the big guys, but at a price tag that fits an SMB budget."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your pricing model? Are there hidden fees?",
    answer: "We hate surprises. We mostly work on fixed-price projects—you know exactly what you're paying before we start. For ongoing stuff like marketing, it's a predictable monthly retainer. No hidden 'server setup fees' or 'admin charges' popped on you at the end."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer payment plans for larger projects?",
    answer: "Yes, we understand cash flow is king for SMBs. For larger implementations, we can often structure payments across milestones—so you pay as we deliver value, not all upfront."
  },
  {
    question: "Am I locked into a long-term contract?",
    answer: "No handcuffs here. Project work has a clear start and end. For monthly services like SEO or support, we operate on a 30-day notice period. We want you to stay because we're getting results, not because a contract forces you to."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take before I see actual results?",
    answer: "It depends on the project, but we move fast. A website can be live in 4 weeks. Digital marketing usually shows traction in 3 months. An ERP implementation might take 3-6 months. We'll give you a realistic timeline day one, not a 'guesstimate'."
  },
  {
    question: "How involved do I need to be? I'm already swamped.",
    answer: "We respect your time. We'll need you for the initial strategy and key approvals, but we handle the heavy lifting. We generally need about 1-2 hours of your time per week to keep things moving smoothly."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I have a dedicated project manager?",
    answer: "Yes! You won't be chasing down developers or designers. You'll have one dedicated point of contact who knows your project inside out and keeps everything on track."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we communicate? Email, WhatsApp, Slack?",
    answer: "Whatever works best for you. We usually set up a shared Slack or WhatsApp group for quick updates, and use email/Zoom for official milestones. You'll never feel out of the loop."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a tech team in-house to manage what you build?",
    answer: "Nope. We build systems that are easy for non-techies to manage. Plus, we provide training and 60-90 days of support after launch. If you need long-term help, our maintenance plans start at just ₹2,999/month."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my website goes down at 2 AM on a Sunday?",
    answer: "We've got your back. We monitor critical systems 24/7. If something breaks, our emergency support team jumps in. You sleep, we fix it."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help me rank higher on Google? My competitors are everywhere.",
    answer: "Yes, that's our bread and butter. We don't just 'do SEO'; we look at how to get you actual leads. We'll audit your competitors, find the gaps, and build a strategy to get you visible to the right customers."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate your software with the old accounting system I've used for 10 years?",
    answer: "Usually, yes! We specialize in integrations. Whether it's Tally, an old SQL database, or a legacy CRM, we can often build bridges to connect it with modern tools so you don't have to throw everything away."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the first step to getting a quote?",
    answer: "Just reach out! Book a free 30-minute consultation. No sales pressure. We'll chat about what you need, and if we're a good fit, we'll send you a proposal within 48 hours."
