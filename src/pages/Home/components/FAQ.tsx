  strategy: [
    {
      q: "How long does it *really* take to launch a website?",
      a: "We move fast. For our **Starter** and **Business** packages, we have a strict **7-14 day delivery timeline**. Custom Enterprise projects or complex E-commerce stores typically take 3-5 weeks depending on the number of products and custom features."
    },
    {
      q: "Who owns the code and design after you're done?",
      a: "You do. 100%. Once the final payment is cleared, we transfer full intellectual property rights, source code, and admin credentials to you. We don't hold your business hostage."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need to have all my content ready before we start?",
      a: "Not necessarily. We can start with a 'Content Frame' using placeholder text to get the structure right. However, having your text and images ready helps us launch faster. If you need help writing content, we offer AI-enhanced copywriting services."
    },
    {
      q: "What do you need from me to get started?",
      a: "Just three things: 1) Your logo (if you have one), 2) A rough idea of pages you need (e.g., Home, About, Services), and 3) Examples of websites you like. We handle the rest."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you outsource your work to freelancers?",
      a: "No. FactoryJet is a fully in-house team of architects, designers, and developers. This ensures strict quality control, data security, and communication speed."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I have to pay everything upfront?",
      a: "No. We typically work on a **50% advance** to book your slot and start the work, and the remaining **50% before the final handover** and launch."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)?",
      a: "Absolutely. We work with many startups and enterprises with sensitive ideas. We are happy to sign an NDA before we discuss your project details."
    }
  ],
  design: [
    {
      q: "Do you use pre-made templates or custom designs?",
      a: "We use a **Hybrid Approach**. We have our own proprietary high-performance component library (like LEGO blocks) that allows us to build custom-looking sites extremely fast. For Enterprise clients, we design 100% from scratch using Figma."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I don't like the design?",
      a: "That's why we have a Revision Phase. We design the homepage first and get your feedback. Our packages include 2-3 rounds of major revisions to ensure the visual style matches your vision perfectly."
    },
    {
      q: "Will my website look good on mobile phones?",
      a: "It will look *better* on mobile. We follow a **Mobile-First Design** philosophy. Since 80% of traffic comes from phones, we design for the smallest screen first to ensure perfect usability."
    },
    {
      q: "Can you redesign my existing website without losing my SEO?",
      a: "Yes. This is a delicate process called 'SEO Migration'. We map all your old URLs to the new ones (301 redirects) so you don't lose your Google ranking juice during the upgrade."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you provide stock images?",
      a: "Yes, we have access to premium libraries like Shutterstock and Unsplash. We also use Generative AI (Midjourney) to create unique, copyright-free visuals for your brand."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I request specific fonts or colors?",
      a: "Of course. If you have a Brand Guide, we follow it strictly. If not, we will recommend a color palette and typography that aligns with your industry psychology."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you design logos?",
      a: "Basic text-based logos are included. For professional brand identity design (Logo, Letterhead, Visiting Cards), we have a separate 'Branding Add-on' package."
    }
  ],
  tech: [
    {
      q: "Which platform do you use to build websites?",
      a: "We select the best tool for the job. For 90% of SMBs, we use **WordPress** (for flexibility) or **Shopify** (for e-commerce). For high-scale startups, we use **Next.js/React** (the same tech used by Netflix/Uber)."
    },
    {
      q: "Is hosting included in the package?",
      a: "Our **AMC (Annual Maintenance)** plans include premium cloud hosting. If you prefer to manage it yourself, we can deploy the site on your own AWS, Godaddy, or Hostinger account."
    },
    {
      q: "Will my website be fast?",
      a: "Blazing fast. We target a **Google PageSpeed score of 90+**. We use caching, image compression (WebP), and CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to ensure your site loads in under 2 seconds."
    },
    {
      q: "Is the website secure from hackers?",
      a: "Security is a priority. We install enterprise-grade firewalls, SSL certificates, and limit login attempts. Our AMC plans also include daily cloud backups so your data is never lost."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I get a professional email address (e.g., ceo@mycompany.com)?",
      a: "Yes, we can set up professional business emails via Google Workspace (G-Suite) or Zoho Mail integration."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I update the content myself later?",
      a: "100%. We build with 'No-Code' editors (like Elementor or Gutenberg). You can change text, images, and prices as easily as editing a Word document. We provide a training video on handover."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if the site breaks at 2 AM?",
      a: "If you are on our **Growth** or **VIP** AMC plan, we have 24/7 uptime monitoring. Our team gets an alert instantly and fixes critical server issues."
    }
  ],
  ecommerce: [
    {
      q: "Shopify vs WooCommerce - which one is better?",
      a: "Simple answer: **Shopify** is better if you want a hands-off, managed platform and don't mind monthly fees. **WooCommerce** is better if you want full control, lower long-term costs, and deep customization. We build on both."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I sell internationally?",
      a: "Yes. We can set up multi-currency converters and international payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal) so you can accept payments in USD, EUR, etc."
    },
    {
      q: "How many products can I upload?",
      a: "Technically unlimited. Our 'Shop Starter' plan covers setup for 20 products, but the system can handle thousands. We teach you how to bulk upload using CSV/Excel."
    },
    {
      q: "Can you integrate Razorpay / PhonePe / Stripe?",
      a: "Yes. We integrate all major Indian and International payment gateways. We ensure the checkout flow is secure and smooth."
    },
    {
      q: "How are shipping rates calculated?",
      a: "We integrate logistics partners like **Shiprocket** or **Pickrr**. This allows real-time shipping rate calculation based on the customer's pincode and package weight."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you support 'Abandoned Cart Recovery'?",
      a: "Yes! This is a standard feature in our **Shop Pro** plan. If a customer leaves without buying, they get an automatic email/WhatsApp reminder to complete the purchase."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I manage inventory across Amazon and my website?",
      a: "Yes, we can set up 'Omnichannel' inventory sync so that when you sell an item on Amazon, stock decreases on your website automatically (requires specific ERP integrations)."
    }
  ],
  seo: [
    {
      q: "Will I rank #1 on Google immediately?",
      a: "No agency can guarantee #1 rankings overnight (and you should run from those who do). However, we build the **Foundation for #1**. We ensure your structure, keywords, speed, and schema are perfect so Google *loves* your site."
    },
    {
      q: "What is AIO / GEO Optimization?",
      a: "**Artificial Intelligence Optimization**. People are now searching on ChatGPT and Gemini, not just Google. We optimize your content so these AI bots can read and cite your business as a trusted answer."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you write the content for the website?",
      a: "We provide 'UX Copywriting' for headlines and buttons. For long-form blogs or product descriptions, we offer AI-assisted content writing services as an add-on."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you set up Google Analytics?",
      a: "Yes. We set up **GA4 (Google Analytics 4)** and **Google Search Console** so you can see exactly how many visitors you have and where they come from."
    },
    {
      q: "Is technical SEO included?",
      a: "Yes. XML Sitemaps, Robots.txt, Schema Markup, Open Graph tags, and Alt tags are standard in every single package we sell."
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle Core Web Vitals?",
      a: "We obsess over it. We optimize LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) to ensure you pass Google's Core Web Vitals assessment."
    }
  ],
  support: [
    {
      q: "Are there any hidden monthly fees?",
      a: "For the website build: **No**. It is a one-time cost. The only recurring costs are Domain (yearly) and Hosting (yearly). If you choose Shopify, you pay them a monthly subscription."
    },
    {
      q: "What is an AMC and is it mandatory?",
      a: "AMC is **Annual Maintenance Contract**. It is NOT mandatory, but highly recommended. It acts like insurance. We handle backups, plugin updates, and security scans so you don't have to worry about your site crashing."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you offer refunds?",
      a: "We have a milestone-based refund policy. If you cancel before the design phase starts, we refund the advance. Once design/coding work has begun, the advance is non-refundable to cover labor costs."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I upgrade from 'Starter' to 'Business' later?",
      a: "Yes! Our architecture is scalable. You can start small and upgrade your package as your revenue grows. We just charge the difference."
    },
    {
      q: "How do we communicate during the project?",
      a: "We create a dedicated **WhatsApp Group** for quick updates and use Email/Zoom for formal reviews. You will have a dedicated Project Manager."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens after the website is launched?",
      a: "We don't ghost you. We provide a 30-day bug-fix support period for free. After that, you can sign up for an AMC or contact us for ad-hoc updates at an hourly rate."
